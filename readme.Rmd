## Visualizing COVID-19 Data Provided by The Italian Ministry of Health

This Shiny App gets the data directly from [the github project](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19) in which the [Italian Civil Protection Department](http://www.protezionecivile.it/risk-activities/health-risk/emergencies/coronavirus) is sharing updates on the regional and provencial increase in cases.

## Preprocessing

Some preprocessing of the data is happening here, like converting the date strings to Date.
Another important change is that the accumulative number of cases has been converted to the daily number of (new) cases. I have noticed that there are some negative values in the data set and I still haven't explored the reason.
